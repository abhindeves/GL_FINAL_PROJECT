## 📚 Data Collection <a name="data-collection"></a>
- 📰 **News Data**: We scraped over 24 years of news headlines from trusted sources like Forbes, CNBC, and Microsoft News, totaling 1.4 million headlines.
- 📈 **Stock Price Data**: Finance provided us with historical stock price data, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>
- 🔄 **Cleaning and Imputation**: We removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted the scraped data for further analysis.
- 📝 **Text Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing was not required for the VADER sentiment analysis module
- 😃 **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilized Vader sentiment analysis to extract polarity and subjectivity scores from news headlines. Also used TextBlob from NLTK to get positive, negative, neutral, and compound values.
  
## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>
- 🌐 **Word Cloud**: Created a word cloud with the 24+ year data to visualize common words in headlines.
- 📊 **News Frequency Analysis**: Plotted the frequency of news articles by source to identify key contributors.
- 📈 **Stock Price Visualization**: Visualized historical stock price data to identify trends and patterns.

## 🎯 Feature Engineering <a name="feature-engineering"></a>
- 🔍 **Combining Data**: Combined processed news data and stock price data into a single dataset.
- 📈 **Creating New Features**: Used rolling window functions to generate features such as moving averages, RSI, and other technical indicators from stock price data.
- 📊 **News Features**: Incorporated sentiment scores and other text analysis features derived from news headlines.

## 🤖 Model Selection and Training <a name="model-selection-and-training"></a>
- 🧠 **Model Selection**: Explored various models including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and others.
- 🚂 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tuned hyperparameters using techniques like grid search to optimize model performance.
- 🎯 **Training**: Trained the selected models on the training data.

## 📊 Model Evaluation <a name="model-evaluation"></a>
- 📏 **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilized confusion matrix as the main metric to evaluate model performance, providing precision, accuracy, and F1 score for binary classification of market movement.
- 🥇 **Comparison**: Compared the performance of different models and selected the one with the highest accuracy.

## 💡 Interpretation and Insights <a name="interpretation-and-insights"></a>
- 📖 **Interpreting Results**: Analyzed coefficients or feature importance scores of the selected model to understand the impact of different features on predicting market movement.
- 📈 **Analyzing Predictions**: Examined model predictions in the context of real-world events and market dynamics to gain actionable insights.

## 🚀 Deployment and Monitoring <a name="deployment-and-monitoring"></a>
- 🌐 **Model Deployment**: Deployed the trained model into a production environment for real-time predictions.
- 📊 **Performance Monitoring**: Implemented mechanisms to monitor model performance over time, retraining periodically with new data to maintain accuracy and reliability.

## 🏁 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Predicting tomorrow's stock market movement using news and stock price data is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. By following the detailed process outlined in this guide, investors can leverage advanced machine learning techniques to gain valuable insights and make informed trading decisions in dynamic financial markets. However, it's essential to remember that no model can perfectly predict market movements and risk management strategies should always be employed to mitigate potential losses. 📉📈
